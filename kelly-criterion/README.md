# Kelly-Criterion Analysis
 
The goal of this project is to enhance the understanding of the Kelly Criterion, a strategy for bet sizing that optimizes long-term wealth growth. The Kelly Criterion is based on maximizing the expected logarithmic growth of wealth by adjusting bet sizes according to the probability of winning and the odds offered.

This project utilizes Monte Carlo simulations to model different betting scenarios and analyze how the Kelly Criterion performs under various conditions. The simulations are designed to run thousands of trials of a betting strategy, with each trial following the logic of the Kelly Criterion to adjust bet sizes dynamically. By doing so, we aim to explore the practical effectiveness of the Kelly strategy in terms of wealth growth, risk, and volatility.

Key components of the project:

⊳ Monte Carlo Simulations: A set of random trials is run to simulate a range of betting scenarios, including different probabilities of winning, bet sizes, and odds. The Monte Carlo method helps estimate how the Kelly Criterion would perform over many iterations and under various conditions.  

⊳ Bet Sizing Optimization: The Kelly Criterion adjusts bet sizes based on the ratio of edge to odds, aiming to maximize the expected value of the portfolio. Through simulations, we analyze how well the criterion adapts to different risk profiles and how frequently it achieves optimal performance.  

⊳ Comparative Analysis: We compare the Kelly Criterion against other betting strategies (e.g., fixed percentage betting, Martingale) in terms of risk-adjusted returns, drawdowns, and overall performance. The results of the Monte Carlo simulations provide insight into the advantages and drawbacks of using Kelly’s approach in real-world betting and investing scenarios.  

⊳ Visualization: Graphs and charts are created to visualize the growth of wealth over time for each strategy, showing the compounded returns and volatility. This helps in understanding the real-world impact of Kelly Criterion on financial portfolios.  

⊳ Sensitivity Analysis: To assess the robustness of the Kelly Criterion, the project examines how the results vary under different levels of risk tolerance, bet sizes, and changing probabilities. This analysis helps to identify situations where the Kelly Criterion may be suboptimal or prone to risk.  

By the end of the project, I aim to provide a comprehensive analysis of the Kelly Criterion's performance in both theoretical and practical settings, using Monte Carlo simulations to highlight its strengths and limitations in maximizing returns while controlling for risk.
