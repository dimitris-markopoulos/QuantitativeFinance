### About the Repository

This repository contains various projects related to **quantitative finance**, including financial modeling, risk analysis, and optimization strategies. So far, it includes:

- **Option Pricing**: Implementations of Monte Carlo simulations for option pricing under both the Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) and Heston models as well as exotics.
- **Implied Volatility & Volatility Smile**: Calculations of implied volatility and volatility smile to analyze market behavior.
- **Betting Strategies**: Simulations based on the Kelly Criterion for optimal betting and investment strategies.

The project is constantly evolving, and new techniques and models will be added over time. The goal is to create a resource for those interested in quantitative finance and to share code for financial simulations and analyses.
